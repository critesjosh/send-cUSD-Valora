# A simple Celo React Native app w/ Expo

This directory contains a simple [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app with the [Expo](https://expo.io/) development framework. 

Look in [App.js](App.js) to see an example of how to use the [Celo DappKit SDK](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/overview/introduction/dappkit) and prompt a user to send cUSD to an address.

## Get Started

- clone the repo and run `yarn` in the project root
- install the [Alfajores testnet wallet](https://celo.org/developers/wallet) on the device you are developing on
- setup your account on the testnet wallet and get testnet funds via the [faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet)
- run `expo start` to start the application

**Note that this dapp is configured to run as a native mobile application. You can find more information about how to run a web based application with dappkit [here](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/dappkit/usage#dappkit-vs-dappkit-web).**
